          <h2><strong>Ellembee</strong></h2>
          <p>
            The house (called “Ellembee”) is located at 2 Moonbird Street,
            Lady Barron.
          </p>
          <h3>Directions:</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>Turn right out of the airport, towards Whitemark.</li>
            <li>
              When you reach a T intersection, turn right towards Whitemark
              (again).
            </li>
            <li>
              Before you reach Whitemark, there will be a left turn for the
              road to Lady Barron.
            </li>
            <li>Drive for 20 to 25 minutes towards Lady Barron.</li>
            <li>
              Just before Lady Barron, turn left into Vinegar Hill Drive,
              just where the 50kph speed limit starts.
            </li>
            <li>Then take the first right into Moonbird Street.</li>
            <li>Ellembee is the first house on the right.</li>
          </ul>
          <h3>Parking and Entry</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>
              You can park in the carport or outside near the balcony on the
              street-side.
            </li>
            <li>
              You can enter the house through the garage (the smallest key
              unlocks the garage swing-door) or you can use the steps up to
              the front entrance on the road-side of the house.
            </li>
          </ul>
        
          <h3>Water and Power</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>
              The house currently uses town water, which you need to turn on
              when you arrive, and off when you leave. The blue tap is
              outside the house, at the opposite end to the garage, on the
              ground near the gas bottles. See pics below:
            </li>
            <li>
              Ignore the water pump near the outside hot-water tank. That is
              for fresh rain- water, but the rain-water tank is currently
              empty.
            </li>
            <li>
              Just inside the garage on the right-hand-side is the power
              switchboard – turn on the hot water (UP is on). Please be very
              sure to turn it off when you leave!
            </li>
          </ul>
          <h3>Entering the House</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Once you open the garage door, go through the downstairs spare
              bedroom (the “dungeon”!) and up the stairs to the main living
              area. There may be some spider cobwebs on the way – sorry!
            </li>
            <li>Open the curtains and enjoy!</li>
            <li>
              If you enter via the steps/balcony at the front, then you will
              be entering via the laundry to the kitchen. We store the Weber
              BBQ in the laundry – so you can move that out onto the balcony
              for the duration of your stay J
            </li>
          </ul>
          <h3>Mobile Phone Coverage</h3>
          <p>
            The only mobile phone coverage on the island is Telstra 4G.
            Phones from other companies like Optus or Vodafone will NOT work
            on the island. Telstra mobiles have reasonable coverage on most
            of the island.
          </p>
          <h3>Phone</h3>
          <p>
            There is no fixed-line phone in the house (well... not one that
            works, anyway).
          </p>

              The commercial airline is
              <strong>Sharp Airlines.</strong> Leaving from Essendon in
              Melbourne, or Launceston or Hobart in Tasmania. for your

              Sharp Airlines leaves from <b>ESSENDON airport</b> – main
              passenger terminal – not from Tullamarine / Melbourne Airport.
              The passenger terminal is next to the Essendon Fields shopping
              centre carpark.
          </div>
          <div>
            <strong>You need to arrive about one hour before departure.</strong>
            There is long-term car-parking in the shopping centre car-park
            just opposite the passenger terminal (about $8 per day – and you
            enter your Rego Plate into the meter machine). If you are less
            than 30-minutes early, there is a good chance that they will not
            let you on the flight. You need to take Photo ID for all
            passengers. Maximum luggage is 21kg per person – including
            carry-on stuff (which they will weigh). The flight (19-seater
            plane) will land at Whitemark airport on Flinders Island. The
            airport is a 2-minute drive from the town of Whitemark, and
            about 20 minutes’ drive from the house in Lady Barron.
            <strong>
              is Tasmanian quarantine on the island – i.e. you cannot bring
              fresh fruit or vegetables to the island.</strong>

          <div class="shopping">
            <p>
              See the latest information at:
              <a href="https://flindersisland.app/">https://flindersisland.app/</a>
            </p>
            <p>
              There are 2 grocery shops. A supermarket in Whitemark (M-F 9-5.30;
              Sa 9-12; on the main street opposite the pub). A very
              comprehensive mini-mart/shop in Lady Barron (Normally M-F 8-5;
              Sa/Su 9-1; near the corner of Gunter and Henwood Streets). Petrol
              is available at the Lady Barron shop, or in Whitemark at 24/7
              automated bowsers with credit card.
            </p>
            <p>
              The Whitemark pub does traditional (huge and simple) pub meals,
              but is closed Sunday evenings (sometimes they do pizza or burgers
              on Sunday early-evenings before 6pm). The Whitemark pub also does
              simple breakfasts/brunches in their ‘corner café’ 7 days per week
              (before 12 noon). The Furneaux Tavern (Lady Barron) has restaurant
              and bar meals every night (Monday night is pizza only) and most
              lunches. Both operate on country-town hours – you need to arrive
              soon after 6pm, and meals will finish about 8pm. In summer and
              public holidays, you need to book for the Tavern (03 6359 3521).
              There are electric/gas public barbeques at many places around the
              island – good for a day-trip. E.g. Killiecrankie Beach; Trousers
              Point; Patriarchs Wildlife Sanctuary.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div class="restaurants">
            <p>
              There are two restaurants – The Flinders Wharfshed in Whitemark
              (brunch and dinner on limited days – usually Wednesday to Saturday
              – phone 0474 889 236), and Mountain Seas Lodge, Trousers Point
              (dinner on limited days – phone/text 0427 593 601). Phone both for
              reservations for dinner. The Wharfshed is a bit pretentious and
              expensive – and not in favor with the locals. Mountain Seas is
              great.
            </p>
            <p>
              Whitemark also has a bakery – good for pies – including the local
              specialty – Wallaby Pie (actually the plain pies are better).
              There is a butcher in Whitemark (M-F only). Next to the butcher in
              Whitemark is a great café – “Cate Cooks” – usually open Weds-Sat
              mornings – and highly recommended for yummy takeaways. There is a
              ‘food van’ in the street around the corner from the Whitemark
              hotel (Bowman Street) – usually open Thurs-Sun 12-3pm or until
              sold out – usually has very good burgers, fried chicken, hot dogs,
              etc. Sunday evenings, ‘The Club’ is open for meals at the
              Whitemark golf course. The most up-to-date information on all
              these is the Facebook – Flinders Island Community Noticeboard:
              <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/1563410353906391">https://www.facebook.com/groups/noticeboard</a>
            </p>
            <p>
              There is one ATM on the island located in the butcher in
              Whitemark, there is also a bank in Whitemark (limited hours M-F),
              and most places take credit cards and EFTPOS (with cash-out at the
              Lady Barron shop). If you are buying petrol from the Lady Barron
              shop – they prefer cash or EFTPOS, not credit card – in fact they
              love cash all the time.

            <h3>Tips for various appliances</h3>

          <p>
            <strong>Washing Machine:</strong> The left-hand slot is for
            washing liquid/powder. The middle slot is for fabric softener. The
            right-hand slot is only used for pre-wash cycles. For the controls
            – working from left to right – press the power button on. Then
            press the circular button to select “Quick 30” (all the others
            take ages). Then press the small buttons to select options – I
            usually increase the spin-speed and temp by one place, and select
            Rinse+. Then press the Start button (the sort-of- triangle to the
            lower-right of the big round button). If the machine does not
            start, press the door closed more firmly – i.e. give it a shove.
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>Nespresso Coffee Machine:</strong> You need to empty used
            coffee pods – gently press in the container, then it will pop out.
            Also empty the drip-tray when the red, plastic button pops up.
            Fill the water tank at the back of the machine. Press the
            Start/Cancel button to start the machine. Choose your coffee type
            by turning the knob. Lift the lever to eject used pod – and then
            put a fresh one in the space and close the lever. If you are
            making a milk coffee – it will do the coffee part first, then the
            milk heating/frothing. Put your mug under the spout and press the
            Start/Cancel button again – the coffee will be poured. Remove your
            mug, and put a metal jug with milk under the milk spout – making
            sure that the jug sits well back in the machine to cover the
            temperature sensor. Fill the jug to one of the lines inside –
            depending on how much milk you need. For cappuccino (lots of
            froth) – use the lower line. Press the Start/Cancel button and the
            milk will heat and froth automatically – you don’t need to do
            anything. Wipe down the milk spout afterwards. The machine turns
            off automatically.
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>Fridge:</strong> The top tray in the fridge has a front
            flap that appears really annoying. But if you pull the whole tray
            towards you, the flap opens automatically – and it is quite handy.
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>TV / Video:</strong> There are 2 remote controls on the
            table next to one of the lounge chairs: The silver remote is for
            the Apple TV – and is the one that controls nearly everything.
            First press the button on the silver remote with the square on it.
            If the TV does not start in a moment, press the red power button –
            top-left on the black remote (this is the only time you should
            need to use the black remote control). Wait a little while, and
            press the silver remote button with the square again – which
            should bring up the Apple TV menu. From there, you can use the
            silver Apple TV remote to move around the menu – and control the
            volume with the +/- button. The “<” button means ‘go back’. Choose catch-up free-to-air TV apps like ABC Iview – or
              choose Plex for a huge selection of TV shows and movies. </p>

                <p>
                  You are the cleaner! When you arrive, you will probably find
                  some dirty sheets and towels in the laundry from the last
                  visitors – it’s your job to wash and dry them! When you leave,
                  please put clean sheets on your bed(s) and leave your washing
                  in the laundry for the next visitors. Please hang damp towels
                  in the laundry – and don’t leave things in the washing machine
                  – or they will go mouldy. You need to turn on the power and
                  water to the washing machine and dryer – and please turn them
                  off when you leave.
                </p>
                <p>
                  There is no rubbish collection. You need to take your rubbish
                  to the Lady Barron waste transfer station. It’s about a
                  1-minute drive on the road to Whitemark – you will have passed
                  it on your way to the house. There is a sign.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The toilets work on a septic-tank-type system. So please, only
                  flush the “3Ps” – poo, pee, and paper. Also, please try to
                  avoid food and other scraps going down the kitchen sink – put
                  them in the bin instead.
